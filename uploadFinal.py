            <strong>Implications of Medium Neurogenesis:</strong><br>
            • Moderate neurogenesis, sufficient for standard brain functions but with potential for enhancement.<br>
            • May support everyday memory and emotional resilience but could be improved for optimal brain plasticity.<br>
            • This level often results from balanced lifestyle habits but may benefit from specific enhancements.<br>

            <strong>Recommended Suggestions:</strong><br>
            • <strong>Exercise:</strong> Engage in moderate aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, swimming) to stimulate neurogenesis.<br>
            • <strong>Nutrition:</strong> Eat a nutrient-rich diet with antioxidants, omega-3s, and vitamins (e.g., B12, D) to promote neurogenesis.<br>
            • <strong>Mindfulness Practices:</strong> Incorporate meditation, yoga, or other stress-relieving practices.<br>

            • <strong>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):</strong> Incorporate HIIT exercises to strongly stimulate neurogenesis.<br>
            • <strong>Supplementation:</strong> Consider omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and possibly curcumin for neurogenic support.<br>
            • <strong>Cognitive Therapy:</strong> Engage in cognitive therapy or mentally stimulating activities (e.g., puzzles, learning a new skill).<br>
